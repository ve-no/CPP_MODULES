# C++ Module 07 - C++ Templates ðŸ“¦

Welcome to Module 07 of the C++ course! In this module, you'll dive into the fascinating world of C++ templates. Templates are a powerful feature of C++ that allow you to write generic code that can work with different data types.

## Introduction
Templates are like magical blueprints in C++. They allow you to write functions and classes that can adapt to different data types, making your code more flexible and reusable. Get ready to explore the power of templates in this module!

## General Rules
Before you start crafting your template magic, remember these general rules. They'll guide you to success:

### Exercise 00: Start with a Few Functions
In this exercise, you'll create three powerful function templates: `swap`, `min`, and `max`. These templates can handle any data type, provided the arguments have the same type and support comparison operators. Prepare for some serious type-agnostic coding!

### Exercise 01: Iter
Your mission in this exercise is to implement a function template called `iter`. It takes an array, its length, and a function as parameters. This template should work with any data type and apply the given function to each element of the array. It's like applying magic spells to every item in your array!

### Exercise 02: Array
In this exercise, you'll create a versatile `Array` class template. It can hold elements of any data type and provides essential functionality like construction, copying, assignment, subscript access, and more. Imagine having an array that can adapt to any data type you throw at it!
