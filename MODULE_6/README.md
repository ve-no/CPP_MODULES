## Introduction
C++ is a versatile language, and this module takes you deeper into its magic. You'll explore C++ casts, master the art of serialization, and identify real types. It's a fascinating journey into the heart of C++!

## General Rules
Before you embark on your coding adventure, here are the general rules that will guide you through this module. These rules ensure consistency and excellence in your code.

### Exercise 00: Conversion of Scalar Types
In this exercise, you'll work with scalar types like char, int, float, and double. Your mission is to create a `ScalarConverter` class that can convert these scalar types from their string representations. Get ready to handle special cases like infinity and NaN!

### Exercise 01: Serialization
Serialization is a vital concept in programming. You'll create a `Serializer` class capable of converting pointers to unsigned integers and back. It's like magic, turning data into something else and back again!

### Exercise 02: Identify Real Type
Ever wondered how to identify the real type of an object? You'll create a set of classes, including `Base`, `A`, `B`, and `C`, and use casting techniques to identify the actual type of objects. It's like a detective game for programmers!

## Resources
To truly master the concepts in this module, here are some resources to help you along the way:

- [C++ Type Casting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-conversion-in-c/): Learn more about type casting in C++.
- [C++ Serialization](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html): Explore the Boost C++ library's serialization capabilities.
- [C++ Polymorphism](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_polymorphism.htm): Understand polymorphism and how it relates to identifying object types.

Happy coding, and may your C++ spells always work as expected!
