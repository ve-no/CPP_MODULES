# üöÄ C++ Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

Welcome to Module 04 of your epic C++ journey! In this module, we're diving headfirst into the captivating world of subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. Get ready to unlock new dimensions of C++ wizardry!

## üéâ What Awaits You

In this module, you're about to embark on a coding adventure that will challenge your C++ skills and make your code sing like a symphony. We'll cover:

- **Polymorphism**: Embrace the beauty of polymorphism by creating an array of creatures that make unique sounds. Cats, dogs, and even some "wrong" creatures await!

- **Abstract Classes**: Learn the art of abstract classes by making sure nobody can instantiate an `Animal`. After all, they make no sound!

- **Interfaces (Sort of)**: Although C++98 doesn't officially have interfaces, we'll simulate them using pure abstract classes. You'll create a magical world of Materias, Characters, and Materia Sources!

## üöÄ Getting Started

To begin your adventure:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the exercise folder you want to tackle (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, `ex03`).

3. Follow the provided guidelines, unleash your creativity, and complete the tasks with panache!

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Tips and Tricks

- Don't be afraid to experiment! C++ is your playground; explore, iterate, and learn.

- Test, test, test! Test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Debugging is the secret ingredient of every great coder.

- Share your creations! We're all in this adventure together. Share your code, insights, and questions with your fellow wizards in the course community.

## üé© Magic Incantations (Commands)

Use these spells to compile and run your C++ sorcery:

```bash
# Compile your code with the necessary flags
$ g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 main.cpp *.cpp -o magic

# Run your enchanted code
$ ./magic


## üéâ What Awaits You

In this module, you're about to embark on a coding adventure that will challenge your C++ skills and make your code sing like a symphony. We'll cover:

### Exercise 00: Polymorphism
- **Polymorphism**: Embrace the beauty of polymorphism by creating an array of creatures that make unique sounds. Cats, dogs, and even some "wrong" creatures await!

### Exercise 01: I don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire
- **Abstract Classes**: Learn the art of abstract classes by making sure nobody can instantiate an `Animal`. After all, they make no sound!

### Exercise 02: Abstract class
- **Abstract Classes (Continued)**: Elevate your code to the next level. Prevent anyone from creating instances of the default `Animal` class.

### Exercise 03: Interface & recap
- **Interfaces (Sort of)**: Although C++98 doesn't officially have interfaces, we'll simulate them using pure abstract classes. You'll create a magical world of Materias, Characters, and Materia Sources!
