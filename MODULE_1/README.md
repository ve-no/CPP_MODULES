## Introduction

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. These modules introduce Object-Oriented Programming using C++98 standard. While modern C++ has evolved, this module provides a foundation.

## General Rules

### Compiling

- Compile your code with `c++` and flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
- Code should still compile with `-std=c++98`

### Formatting and Naming Conventions

- Exercise directories: `ex00`, `ex01`, ..., `exn`
- Class names in UpperCamelCase
- Output messages end with a new-line character
- No enforced coding style, but readability matters

### Allowed/Forbidden

- Use standard library extensively
- Forbidden: external libraries (C++11, Boost), *printf(), *alloc(), free()
- Forbidden: using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords
- STL allowed only in Module 08 and 09

### Design Requirements

- Avoid memory leaks
- Classes must follow Orthodox Canonical Form (Module 02-09)
- No function implementations in header files (except templates)
- Headers should include all dependencies with include guards

### Read Me

- You can add some additional files if you need to (i.e., to split your code). As these assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in the mandatory files.
- Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise look short but the examples can show requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.
- Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.
- By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!
- You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious unless you’re able to script your favorite text editor.
- You are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises. However, follow the mandatory rules and don’t be lazy. You would miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about theoretical concepts.

## Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

- Turn-in directory: `ex00/`
- Files to turn in: `Makefile`, `main.cpp`, `Zombie.{h, hpp}`, `Zombie.cpp`, `newZombie.cpp`, `randomChump.cpp`
- Forbidden functions: None
- Description: Create a Zombie class, implement functions to create and manipulate zombies, and explore memory allocation.

## Exercise 01: Moar brainz!

- Turn-in directory: `ex01/`
- Files to turn in: `Makefile`, `main.cpp`, `Zombie.{h, hpp}`, `Zombie.cpp`, `zombieHorChapter I -
- Forbidden functions: None
- Description: Create a horde of Zombies, allocate memory, and explore memory allocation and deallocation.

## Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN

- Turn-in directory: `ex02/`
- Files to turn in: `Makefile`, `main.cpp`
- Forbidden functions: None
- Description: Demonstrate memory address manipulation using pointers and references with a string variable.

## Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence

- Turn-in directory: `ex03/`
- Files to turn in: `Makefile`, `main.cpp`, `Weapon.{h, hpp}`, `Weapon.cpp`, `HumanA.{h, hpp}`, `HumanA.cpp`, `HumanB.{h, hpp}`, `HumanB.cpp`
- Forbidden functions: None
- Description: Implement classes for humans and weapons, explore constructors, pointers, and references.

## Exercise 04: Sed is for losers

- Turn-in directory: `ex04/`
- Files to turn in: `Makefile`, `main.cpp`, `*.cpp`, `*.{h, hpp}`
- Forbidden functions: std::string::replace
- Description: Create a program to replace text in a file without using C file manipulation functions.

## Exercise 05: Harl 2.0

- Turn-in directory: `ex05/`
- Files to turn in: `Makefile`, `main.cpp`, `Harl.{h, hpp}`, `Harl.cpp`
- Forbidden functions: None
- Description: Implement a Harl class to automate log messages with different levels, explore pointers to member functions.

## Exercise 06: Harl filter

- Turn-in directory: `ex06/`
- Files to turn in: `Makefile`, `main.cpp`, `Harl.{h, hpp}`, `Harl.cpp`
- Forbidden functions: None
- Description: Create a program to filter and display log messages based on specified log levels using the switch statement.

## Submission and Peer-Evaluation

Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated
