## Introduction
C++ is a powerful programming language, and this module takes you deeper into its intricacies. Repetition and exceptions are key concepts, and you'll also get a taste of the bureaucratic world with forms, bureaucrats, and interns. Let's explore!

## General Rules
Before diving in, it's essential to be aware of the general rules that apply throughout this module. These rules ensure consistency and quality in your code.

### Exercise 00: Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!
In this exercise, you'll step into the shoes of a bureaucrat. You'll create a `Bureaucrat` class and deal with grades and exceptions. Be ready to catch those exceptions!

### Exercise 01: Form up, maggots!
Forms, forms, and more forms! You'll create a `Form` class, sign it, execute it, and deal with exceptions along the way. It's all about paperwork!

### Exercise 02: No, you need form 28B, not 28C...
Now, you'll extend your form-filling capabilities with concrete form classes like `ShrubberyCreationForm`, `RobotomyRequestForm`, and `PresidentialPardonForm`. Get ready for some fun tasks!

### Exercise 03: At least this beats coffee-making
Interns to the rescue! You'll create an `Intern` class, the unsung heroes of the bureaucratic world. They'll create forms and get things done efficiently.

## Resources
To truly master the concepts in this module, here are some resources to help you along the way:
